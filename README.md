# Queues

There are 2 different Queues in this project as follows
## 1- double-ended Queue
which  is a generalization of a stack and a queue that supports adding and removing items from either the front or the back of the data structure. 

## 2- Randomized queue.
A randomized queue is similar to a stack or queue, except that the item removed is chosen uniformly at random among items in the data structure.

and there is a Client Application
## Permutation.java 
that takes an integer k as a command-line argument;
reads a sequence of strings from standard input using StdIn.readString();
and prints exactly k of them, uniformly at random
